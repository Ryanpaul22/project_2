          <p>I completed my first week of Back muscle workouts, and I'm feeling really great overall! I actually
            don't *feel* like I'm working out all that much, but I'm starting to realize I need to change my thinking
            about that. Above are my four favorite exercises for killer back. </p>

          <p> Whey Protein Isolate:</p>
          <p>Whey protein isolate is the first essential post workout must-have to aid in maximum recovery. This type
            of protein provides the necessary amino acids to ignite protein synthesis, protecting your muscles from
            catabolism (break down), which you're prone to after an intense training session.</p>

          <p>When it comes to any form of exercise, the natural instinct for most misinformed people is that more is
            better. So if a little of something is supposed to be good, surely a shitload of it will be even better,
            right? Which means, if a couple of chest exercises works, adding a few more will work even better, right?
            Not quite.This "more is better" approach to training almost always crosses that line. </p>

          <p>Creatine HCl</p>
          <p>Creatine supplementation has been proven time and time again to be an effective ergogenic aid for
            athletes. Improving ATP resynthesis allows the working muscles to perform better for longer. In addition
            to consuming creatine before training, it is wise to consume some after exercise to help replenish what
            has been utilized. </p>

          <p>Spring has officially sprung and summer is fast on its heels! As you shed bulky winter wear and revel in
            the warmer weather, you may realize our arms have become a little bit, well, softer than they were last
            year. In an effort to tone up, many people go straight to an arm workout that consists of nothing but
            bicep curls and push-ups</p>

          <p>We've already discussed the importance of the use of easily digestible nutrients in the post-workout
            window as the gut is compromised due to heightened cortisol levels. For this reason, having an effective
            digestive aid in your post-workout shake is beneficial to ensure better nutrient assimilation, yielding
            better recovery and less stomach disturbance.</p>

          <p>If you've mastered crunches, you know they work the rectus abdominis and possibly the obliques. But to
            really hit the muscles deep within your core the transverse abdominis, you need to improve stabilization
            by recruiting those deeper muscle fibers. As for frequency, your abs should be trained on a regular basis
            just like any other muscle group.</p>

          <p> Betaine</p>
          <p>Anhydrous betaine has been shown to help improve strength, power, and muscular endurance. It does this
            in part by promoting better hydration as well as fighting cell stress. Utilizing anhydrous betaine in the
            post-workout window can not only help with recovery, but it will also prepare your body for the next
            intense workout.</p>
